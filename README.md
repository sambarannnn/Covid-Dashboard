# Covid-Dashboard
A Covid-19 Dashboard for tracking total, recovered and fatal cases by pulling data from postman covid-19 API.

1. Built using HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript and Chart.js library for data visualisation.
2. Geolocaion API is used for fetching current user's location and setting it as default.
3. Postman Covid-19 API is used to fetch tracking data which if processed using JS for visualization.
  - Postman Covid-19 API is prone to bugs due to gaps in data.
